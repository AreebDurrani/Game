Guide for implementing cron jobs in Ubuntu to perform automatic tasks. The following is for automated
game database backups that occur daily at 2am and 2pm.


sudo su (become root)

crontab -e (will prompt for editor choice, I like nano so I pick 1)

Paste the following at the bottom:

0 2 * * * make -C /home/YOUR_USER/Game backup
0 14 * * * make -C /home/YOUR_USER/Game backup

(Save and exit (ctrl+x and y)

Make sure you have edited "/home/YOUR_USER/Game/.env" with the database (openrsc_game) as well as your
created MariaDB SQL user and password. The make command refers to a Makefile in the Game directory that
reads environment variables from the hidden .env file in the Game directory.

Verify by changing the 0 2 or 0 14 parts of one of the lines to * * so the crontab will occur every minute.
If successful, a zip file should appear in the "/home/YOUR_USER/Game/data" directory. Example:

root@MariaDB:/home/wolf/Game/data# ls -ls
total 15020
15016 -rw-r--r-- 1 root root 15373449 Mar  7 22:11 20190307-2211-EST.zip
    4 drwxrwxrwx 3 root root     4096 Mar  2 11:35 db
